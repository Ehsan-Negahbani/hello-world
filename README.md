# hello-world
My first GitHub repository
Ehsan is here. I am now learning how to use GitHub. My short-term goal is to be able to upload my codes on GitHub. In long term I want to use GitHub for version control and collabrative work.

Now I want to learn about GitHub flow Guide.
Here is the reference page: https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/
## GitHub flow:
1. ***Create a branch*** off of master branch to work on features, bug fixes, experimentation, etc....
2. ***Add commits*** Each of these works are called commits. Give a clear name to each commit and a summary description of why did you do this commit. Thist will be super helpful in tracking the changes by yourself or your collaborators.
3. **Open a pull request** This will initiate discussion about your commits.  You can mention other people to request them to see your pull request and accept/pull it to master. Pool requests can be openned any time, not just when you finish examining a code. You can open pull request for discussions, sharing screen shots, etc ... even before writing a code.
4. **Continuew discussion** and code review after opening a pull request. 
5. **Deploy** directly from the branch to verify your changes in production. If it fails/causes issues, then you can roll it back by deploying the existing master into production.
6. **Merge** your code into the master branch, now that your changes have been verified in production.
